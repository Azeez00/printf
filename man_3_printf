.TH _printf "18 April 2022" "version 1.0" "Program Manual for _printf"
.SH NAME 
_printf - formatted output conversion and print data.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.PP
.BI "#include ''main.h''"
.PP
.BI "int _printf(const char *format, ...);"
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
The _printf function prints ARGUMENT(s) according to FORMAT, or executes according to the OPTION to the standard output. The function writes the \
output under the control of a format string which specifies how subsequent arguement(s) are accessed via the variable-lenght argument facilities of stdargs(3) are\ 
converted for output.
.SH 
.IP FORMAT:
The format string is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any. Format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters \ 
which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specification (%) each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments. 
.SH
.IP SPECIFIERS:
Conversion specification is introduced by % and ends with a conversion specifier. Conversion specifiers specifies the type of conversion to be applied. \
In between there may be zero or more flags and an optional length modifier. The conversion specifiers of the _printf() function are:
.TP 
.B c
.R The \fIint\fR argument is converted to an \fIunsigned char\fR, and the resulting character is written.
.TP
.B s
.R The \fIconst char *\fR argument is a pointer to an array of characters , that converts the corresponding argument to a character string.
.TP
.B d, i
.R The \fIint\fR is converted to a signed decimal notation.
.TP
.B b
.R The \fIunsigned int\fR argument is converted to a binary.
.TP
.B o, u, x, X
.R The \fIunsigned int\fR argument is converted to unsigned octal \fBo\fR (base 8), unsigned decimal \fBu\fR (base 10), or unsigned hexadecimal \fBx\fR and \fBX\fR notation (base 16).\ 
The letters abcdef are used for \fBx\fR conversions; the letters ABCDEF are used for \fBX\fR conversions.
.TP
.B % %%
.R If only the \fI%\fR character is written no argument is converted. The complete conversion specification is \fI%%\fR, that returns the actual sign if there in front.
.TP
.B S
.R The \fIconst char\fR argument is a pointer to an array of characters, that converts the corresponding argument to a character string, with non-printable characters \
(0 < ASCII value < 32 or >= 127).
.TP
.B p
.R The \fIvoid *\fR pointer argument is printed in hexadecimal (as if by %#x or %#lx).
.TP
.B r
.R The \fIconst char\fR prints the strings in reverse.
.TP
.B R
.R The \fIconst char\fR prints the rot13'ed string.
.SH
.IP FLAGS:
The character % is followed by zero or more of the following flags:
.TP
.B #
.R Prints number in hexadecimal, uppercase hexadecimal and octal where the first character of the output string is made zero.
.TP
.B +
.R A sign \fB+\fR or \fB-\fR will be placed before a number followed by a signed conversion.
.TP 
.B ' '
.R A \fI(space)\fR blank space should be left before a positive number (or empty string) produced by a signed conversion.
.SH
.IP LENGTH-MODIFIER
The "integers conversion" stands for d, i, o, u, x or X.
.TP
.B l
.R (ell) A following integer conversion corresponds to a \fIlong\fR or \fIunsigned long\fR argument, or a following \fBn\fR conversion corresponds to a pointer to a \fIlong\fR ar\
gument or a following \fBc\fR conversion corresponds to an \fIwint_t\fR argument, or a following \fBs\fR conversion corresponds to a pointer to \fwchar_t\fR argument.
.B h
.R A following integer conversion corresponds to a \fshort\fR or \funsigned short char\fR argument,  or a following \fBn\fR conversion coresponds to a pointer to a \fshort\fR argument.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The function returns the number of all characters in the format string excluding the NULL byte used to terminate the loop.
.SH EXAMPLE
.R To print the strings of \fBWe did it!\fR and its length in decimal.

#include ''main.h''

int main(void)

{

	int length;

	_printf(''%s'', ''We did it!'');
	
	length = _printf(''We did it! contains %d characters'', length);

	return (0);

}

.SH NOTES
.R The \fB_print()\fR is a project collaboration between \fBWasiu Bakare\fR and \fBOgunbanjo Nimota Busayo\fR, students of Software Engineering at \fBALX\fR. _printf "version 1.0"\
 is still in Beta testing mode. If bug(s) are detected, please feel free to email \fBwasiubakare@gmail.com\fR or \fBogunbanjonimotabusayo@gmail.com\fR . If you wish to join the development team, please send an email to same address.
